CSE 210 â€“ Final Project Planning

Section 2 questions:

1)	We are going to be building a recreation of the classic game, space invaders. 

2)	We plan to use python to write the code and we will be using the arcade module 
    to help with game flow and graphics. 
    
3)	See wish_list.txt and feature_list.txt

4)	Our timeline is simply the rest of the semester that we have to work on this. 
    Every wee it will just be a matter of completing the most important items first 
    and then moving on to other features once the more important ones are functional. 
    What we start with will be based on the numbers next to the features in the feature list.
